# Chess Discord Bot
Made with [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable), Discord API, and emojis made/taken from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/packs/chess-37).

## Uses
- Play and Compete with your friends against each other in a game of Chess.
- Play against a bot **(In the future)**

## Setup (Currently only for developers)
- [Download latest release here](https://github.com/hornley/Chess-Discord-Bot/releases/latest)

## How to play?
- **!chess (Player_2) (Private_Game_Option) (Player_1_Color)** - Start a game against a player. *(Private_Game_Option is optional, default is **false** and Player_1_Color is also optional, default is **white**)*.
- **!move (Piece_Position_To_Move) (Where_To)** - To move a piece.
- **!finish** - To end a game forcefully without a winner.

## To be Added
- Check, checkmate, and stalemate detection.
- Piece move restrictions, such as blocked move, unable to move a piece due to check.
- En Passant Move
- Invalid Move (i.e. Bishop move is not diagonal)
- Move Collides with a piece (i.e. a4 to h4 but e4 has a piece, therefore it is an invalid move)
- Move will be on another piece of the same color (a.k.a. no friendly fire bitch)
- Given move is not within a to h or 1 - 8 (i.e. 'b9')
- Chosen square is not a piece or does not have a piece on it (i.e. !play a4 a5, but a4 is an empty square)
- !save command to save the game for another time (!continue and paste the given data)
- Flip board for the black player - move based
- ...and more!
