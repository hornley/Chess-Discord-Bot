Chess TO-DO:

Optional:
> !save command to save the game for another time (!continue and paste the given data)
> Only the players can move their pieces, 2 player per board and of their own color
> Private-channel or not option when starting a game
> Flip board for the black player - move based

Errors to be added:
> Invalid Move (i.e. Bishop move is not diagonal)
> Move Collides with a piece (i.e. a4 to h4 but e4 has a piece, therefore it is an invalid move)
> Move will be on another piece of the same color (a.k.a. no friendly fire bitch)
> Given move is not within a to h or 1 - 8 (i.e. 'b9')
> Chosen square is not a piece or does not have a piece on it (i.e. !play a4 a5, but a4 is an empty square)
